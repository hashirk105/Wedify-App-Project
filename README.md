# Wedify-App-Project
 Wedify is a React Native project designed to simplify the process of planning and managing wedding events. It serves as a comprehensive platform that allows both users and admins to efficiently organize all the necessary aspects of a wedding.

With Wedify, users can easily book their dream wedding event by selecting various customizable options. These options include the choice of a marque, food menu selection, guest capacity, and pricing details. Users can personalize their wedding event based on their preferences, ensuring a unique and memorable experience.

The project incorporates Firebase for authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This integration enables secure user authentication, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the platform and book wedding events. Additionally, CRUD operations allow users to manage their bookings effectively, making modifications as needed.

Admins play a crucial role in Wedify, as they have the ability to add, remove, update, and view employees associated with the wedding events. This includes employees such as managers, waiters, and other staff members necessary for the smooth execution of a wedding event. Admins can easily keep track of the event details, make necessary changes, and ensure efficient coordination among the employees.

Wedify aims to provide a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate through the application and seamlessly manage their wedding event plans. By leveraging the power of React Native, Wedify offers a consistent experience across multiple platforms.

Through the combination of Firebase integration, user-friendly design, and comprehensive features, Wedify simplifies the wedding planning process, empowering users to create their dream wedding events with ease.
